This project simulates the gravitational pull a planet does to a smaller object going near it. You can launch objects by clicking your mouse and make them go around the planet and see the gravitational effect. You can make the object do an elliptical orbit around the planet. The project is made with real physics equations using Kepler's laws.

As you can see in the picture you can also see the velocity of the object and the force the planet applies to it.
